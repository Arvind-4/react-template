# React template

A Production ready react template with vite, typescript, tailwind css, docker and nginx.

## 📦 Tech Stack:

- [React](https://react.dev/) - The library for web and native user interfaces.
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - TypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for types.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Next Generation Frontend Tooling.
- [Tailwind 3](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Rapidly build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - Docker is a platform designed to help developers build, share, and run modern applications. We handle the tedious setup, so you can focus on the code.
